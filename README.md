# Auction-Blockchain
Blockchain project for The 2022 Unified Technology Shadow Program

the RemixIDE, and Solidity as our tools. This Repo has the steps for developing a simple Auction
smart contract only using Remix IDE, Solidity and Ganache. 

Remix is an online IDE
which is located at https://remix.ethereum.org/. The online IDE is used to compile our
smart contract. The smart contract resides at a specific address on the Ethereum
blockchain.

Ganache - Local in memory blockchain for development purposes. Installed at
[https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/). This application gives you test accounts and
private keys and can be used with Metamask, which is a way to connect your smart
contract with a web application. Each account in Ganache holds 100 fake ether.

To run this project, copy the smart contract code into the Remix IDE and run the code there connected to your local blockchain network (Ganache)
